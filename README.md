# What is Synnax?

Synnax is a distributed telemetry engine designed to acquire and store data 
from, issue commands to, and process telemetry generated by hardware systems. It 
scales horizontally, and can be deployed on edge devices (data acquisiton) in
highly dynamic environments with intermittent network connectivity, or in cloud
environments (data processing) for high performance analyis.

# Development Status

Synnax is currently in alpha (v0.1.0) and is under active development. The API is 
unstable and may change at any time. Synnax follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
guidelines.

# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions. Reach out to [Emiliano](mailto:emilbon99@gmail.com) 
(emilbon99@gmail.com) if you'd like to get involved. While you wait for a response, 
check out the [New Developer Guide](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/category/developers) 
to get up to speed. Also, feel free to browse through the 
[technical RFCs](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/category/technical-rfcs) to get a sense 
of where we've been and where we're going.

# Repository Organization

Synnax is built as a collection of several projects, all of which are collected
in this monorepo. The following is a list of the services and their purpose:

* [Aspen](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/aspen) - A gossip based
distributed key-value store used for propagating and persisting metadata between
nodes, such cluster topology, state, and configuration. The core RFC for Aspen 
is available [here](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/rfc/2-220518-aspen-distributed-storage). 
* [Cesium](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/cesium) - An embedded
time-series engine optimized for high performance reads and writes of regular telemetry. The
core RFC for Cesium is available [here](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/rfc/1-220517-cesium-segment-storage).
* [Client](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/client) - Client libraries
for synnax available in multiple languages. The implementation for each language
is a subpackage of the client package.
* [Documentation](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/docs) - The technical
and user-facing documentation for Synnax. Contains the code for the Synnax documentation
website, technical RFCs, and additonal media such as logos.
* [Freighter](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/freighter) - A protocol
agnostic network transport for cross-language unary and streaming communication. Freighter
has implementations in several languages; each implementation is contained in a
sub-directory of the freighter service. The core RFC for Freighter is available [here](https://docs.synnaxlabs.com/rfc/6-220809-freighter).
* [Pluto](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/pluto) - A React component
library for building the Synnax user interfaces. This package includes theming
standards (primary colors, grays, errors, fonts, etc.).
* [Synnax](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/synnax) - The core Synnax
server, which integrates all other services to provide a complete telemetry system.
* [X](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/x) - The common utilities
used across all Synnax services. To list a few interesting examples:
  * [Alamos](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/x/alamos) - Dependency
  injected code instrumentation.
  * [Confluence](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/x/confluence) - 
  Assemble and run concurrent data processing and message passing pipelines.
  * [Gorp](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/x/gorp) - Efficient
    querying of go-types to and from a key-value store.
  * [Signal](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/tree/main/x/signal) - A library
    for controlling the lifecycle of communicating sequential processes.
